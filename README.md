# Eyes

Embarking on my fifth project, "the Eyes project," marked a significant leap in my journey as a self-taught web developer. This endeavor built upon the foundational skills I had honed through my previous projectsâ€”shapes creation, dynamic movement with balls, and integrating multiple images with the PacMan project. However, "the Eyes project" introduced a new level of complexity and interactivity by incorporating real-time user input, specifically mouse movements, to control the on-screen elements. This challenge required a deeper dive into JavaScript while refining my HTML and CSS skills to create a responsive and interactive experience.

From the outset, the project seemed daunting. Unlike my prior endeavors where movements were predefined or cyclic, this project necessitated a responsive element that would react to the user's actions in real-time. The core concept was to create a pair of eyes on a webpage that would follow the user's cursor as it moved, simulating the effect of the eyes watching the user's every move. This concept, while fascinating, introduced me to the challenge of mapping mouse coordinates to the movement of elements within a webpage.

The initial steps involved structuring the HTML to create the visual components of the eyes and styling them with CSS to resemble a pair of cartoonish eyes. The real challenge, however, lay in the JavaScript implementation. Capturing the mouse's position and translating that into the movement of the eyes required a solid understanding of event listeners and how to manipulate CSS properties through JavaScript dynamically.

As I delved into this project, I found myself revisiting the fundamentals of event handling in JavaScript. I experimented with the 'mousemove' event to track the cursor's position and learned how to calculate the position of the eyes relative to the cursor. This exploration led me to understand the importance of the viewport's dimensions in determining how elements should move in response to user interaction. The realization that I could map the cursor's position on the screen to the movement of the eyes within their sockets was a breakthrough moment for me.

The CSS part of the project, although initially seeming straightforward, required careful consideration to ensure that the eyes looked natural and that their movement was smooth and constrained within the boundaries of their sockets. I experimented with various CSS properties, such as 'border-radius' and 'overflow', to achieve the desired effect. The use of 'will-change' property to optimize the animations was another key learning point, emphasizing the importance of performance in web animations.

This project was not only a test of the technical skills that I've learned so far but also my patience and perseverance. There were moments of frustration when the eyes would not move as expected or when I encountered unanticipated bugs that seemed to defy logic. Yet, with each challenge, I grew more determined to find a solution, often consulting online forums, revisiting documentation, and experimenting with different approaches until I achieved the desired outcome.

Reflecting on the time and effort invested in "the Eyes project," I am filled with a sense of accomplishment. This project pushed the boundaries of what I thought I was capable of achieving and deepened my understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive web experiences. It was a clear testament to the progress I had made since beginning my coding journey. As an older student diving into the world of coding, this project reinforced the belief that with dedication and a willingness to learn, it is never too late to acquire new skills and bring creative ideas to life through code.
