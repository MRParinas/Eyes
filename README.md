# Eyes
Embarking on my fifth project, "the Eyes project," marked a significant leap in my journey as a self-taught web developer. This endeavor built upon the foundational skills I had honed through my previous projectsâ€”shapes creation, dynamic movement with balls, and integrating multiple images with the PacMan project. However, "the Eyes project" introduced a new level of complexity and interactivity by incorporating real-time user input, specifically mouse movements, to control the on-screen elements. This challenge required a deeper dive into JavaScript while refining my HTML and CSS skills to create a responsive and interactive experience.

From the outset, the project seemed daunting. Unlike my prior endeavors where movements were predefined or cyclic, this project necessitated a responsive element that would react to the user's actions in real-time. The core concept was to create a pair of eyes on a webpage that would follow the user's cursor as it moved, simulating the effect of the eyes watching the user's every move. This concept, while fascinating, introduced me to the challenge of mapping mouse coordinates to the movement of elements within a webpage.

The initial steps involved structuring the HTML to create the visual components of the eyes and styling them with CSS to resemble a pair of cartoonish eyes. The real challenge, however, lay in the JavaScript implementation. Capturing the mouse's position and translating that into the movement of the eyes required a solid understanding of event listeners and how to manipulate CSS properties through JavaScript dynamically.

As I delved into this project, I found myself revisiting the fundamentals of event handling in JavaScript. I experimented with the 'mousemove' event to track the cursor's position and learned how to calculate the position of the eyes relative to the cursor. This exploration led me to understand the importance of the viewport's dimensions in determining how elements should move in response to user interaction. The realization that I could map the cursor's position on the screen to the movement of the eyes within their sockets was a breakthrough moment for me.

The CSS part of the project, although initially seeming straightforward, required careful consideration to ensure that the eyes looked natural and that their movement was smooth and constrained within the boundaries of their sockets. I experimented with various CSS properties, such as 'border-radius' and 'overflow', to achieve the desired effect. The use of 'will-change' property to optimize the animations was another key learning point, emphasizing the importance of performance in web animations.

This project was not only a test of the technical skills that I've learned so far but also my patience and perseverance. There were moments of frustration when the eyes would not move as expected or when I encountered unanticipated bugs that seemed to defy logic. Yet, with each challenge, I grew more determined to find a solution, often consulting online forums, revisiting documentation, and experimenting with different approaches until I achieved the desired outcome.

Reflecting on the time and effort invested in "the Eyes project," I am filled with a sense of accomplishment. This project pushed the boundaries of what I thought I was capable of achieving and deepened my understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive web experiences. It was a clear testament to the progress I had made since beginning my coding journey. As an older student diving into the world of coding, this project reinforced the belief that with dedication and a willingness to learn, it is never too late to acquire new skills and bring creative ideas to life through code.

# How to Run the "Eyes" Program:
1. Clone or Download the Project: First, you'll need to have access to the project files. Since the project is hosted on the GitHub platform, you can clone the repository or download the files directly to your local machine.
2. Open in a Code Editor: Once you have the files, open them in a code editor of your choice. Visual Studio Code is an option (its what I use) that offers a lot of features and extensions to simplify web development.
3. Review the Files: The project should include at least three main files:
  An HTML file (index.html) for the structure.
  A CSS file (styles.css) for the styling.
  A JavaScript file (eyes.js) for the interactive functionality.
4. Open the HTML File in a Web Browser: You can view the project by opening the index.html file in a web browser. You should see a pair of eyes on the screen that follow your cursor as you move it around the window.
5. Interact with the Eyes: Move your mouse around the window to see the eyes follow your cursor. The interaction is the core feature of this project, showcasing real-time response to user input.

# Potential Improvements:
1. Add Blinking Animation: To make the eyes more lifelike, I'm considering probably adding a blinking animation. I think I can achieve this through CSS animations or JavaScript intervals that adjust the height of the .eye elements periodically to simulate blinking.
2. Responsive Design: Probably ensuring that the project is fully responsive so that it looks great on devices of all sizes. This may involve using media queries in my CSS to adjust the layout and size of the eyes based on the viewport dimensions.
3. Multiple Pairs of Eyes: For an added challenge, I may try implementing multiple pairs of eyes on the screen, each pair following the cursor independently. This would probably require modifying the JavaScript to handle multiple elements dynamically.
4. User Interaction Options: I may offer the user some control over the appearance and behavior of the eyes, such as changing the color, size, or speed at which they follow the cursor. This could be implemented using a simple UI with buttons or sliders.
5. Improve Performance: As I try to add more features, I can keep an eye on the performance. Probably use the Chrome DevTools' Performance tab to analyze the animation's efficiency and make adjustments as needed to ensure smooth, jank-free animations.
6. Educational Aspect: Considering my journey and the project's potential as a learning tool, I could add annotations or a tutorial mode that explains the code behind the interaction. This could probably be particularly helpful for new learners like me who are following a similar journey like mine.
